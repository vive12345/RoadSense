# CAN Trace Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates/replays sensor values from a test drive with accurate timing. The simulation uses CAN trace data and GPS coordinates to recreate the exact timing and values recorded during a test drive. The system consists of a Simulator (server) and a Receiver (client) that communicate through a socket connection.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

1. **Simulator**: Acts as a socket server that sends sensor values with accurate timing.
2. **Receiver**: Acts as a client that connects to the Simulator, receives values, and displays them in real-time.
3. **CAN Trace Parser**: Parses the CAN trace file and creates a data structure with the sensor values.
4. **GPS Parser**: Parses the GPS coordinates file and creates a data structure with the GPS coordinates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle 8.x

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory (in this case it's SER540_Team11)

### Compiling and Running

To compile the project, run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Note : Open two terminal on the IDE in one Paste "1. Running the Simulator" and in another terminal paste for client side "2. Running the Receiver"

#### 1. Running the Simulator

To run the Simulator, you need to provide both CAN trace and GPS trace file paths:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="$(pwd)/app/src/main/resources/18CANmessages.trc $(pwd)/app/src/main/resources/GPStrace.txt"
```

#### 2. Running the Receiver

To run the Receiver client:

```bash
./gradlew runReceiver
```

## Troubleshooting

0. **Cache first time Issue**

   - If the ./gradlew runReceiver doesn't work for first time (it's because cache is not established ) therefor try running it the second time again.

1. **Socket Connection Refused**:

   - Ensure the Simulator is running before starting the Receiver
   - Check that port 54000 is not blocked by your firewall

2. **Missing or Invalid Data**:
   - Verify that your CAN trace and GPS trace files are correctly formatted
   - Check that file paths are specified correctly when running the Simulator

```bash
./gradlew run --args="<canfile_path> <GPSfile_path>"
```

3. **Custom gradle file missing **:
   - Issue with running ./gradlew runReceiver command then check if the gradle has this if not add it:

```bash
task runReceiver(type: JavaExec) {
    description = 'Run the Receiver application'
    group = 'application'
    mainClass = 'org.automotive.Receiver'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}
```

4. **Others**:
   - Try to clean build you Gradle

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

## LOG FILE DESIGN

#### CAN Frame Format

```
CAN|ID|TIMESTAMP|FRAME_TYPE-VALUES|CURRENT_TIME
```

Example:

```
CAN|0018|443.8|STEERING|SteeringWheelAngleFrame [ID=0018, Time=443.8, Angle=2.0Â°] | 447ms
CAN|0B41|6.8|DYNAMICS|-0.8799999999999955|0.7200000000000006|-0.2400000000000002 | 31ms
CAN|0F7A|467.1|SPEED|VehicleSpeedFrame [ID=0F7A, Time=467.1, Speed=73.3 km/h] | 470ms
```

#### GPS Data Format

```
GPS|TIMESTAMP|LATITUDE|LONGITUDE|CURRENT_TIME
```

Example:

```
[ GPS ]|0.0|52.721103|13.223500 | 16ms
```

## Implementation Details

### Timing Mechanism

The simulation maintains accurate timing by:

1. Tracking the real system time since simulation start
2. Calculating the appropriate wait time before sending each message
3. Ensuring sensor values are delivered at exactly the same offsets as in the original recordings

### Multithreading

- The Simulator uses separate threads for each client connection
- The Receiver uses separate threads for socket reception and message processing

#### as we can see that the when GPStrace.txt file has no data then the startsimulation is printing a error msg
