# CAN Trace Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates/replays sensor values from a test drive with accurate timing. The simulation uses CAN trace data and GPS coordinates to recreate the exact timing and values recorded during a test drive. The system consists of a Simulator (server) and a Receiver (client) that communicate through a socket connection.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

1. **Simulator**: Acts as a socket server that sends sensor values with accurate timing.
2. **Receiver**: Acts as a client that connects to the Simulator, receives values, and displays them in real-time.
3. **CAN Trace Parser**: Parses the CAN trace file and creates a data structure with the sensor values.
4. **GPS Parser**: Parses the GPS coordinates file and creates a data structure with the GPS coordinates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle 8.x

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

### Compiling and Running

#### Compiling the Project

To compile the project, run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Running the Simulator

To run the Simulator, you need to provide both CAN trace and GPS trace file paths:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="$(pwd)/app/src/main/resources/18CANmessages.trc $(pwd)/app/src/main/resources/GPStrace.txt"
```

#### Running the Receiver

To run the Receiver client:

```bash
./gradlew runReceiver
```

## Project Features

### Simulation Features

- Real-time playback of sensor values with precise timing
- Concurrent handling of CAN frames and GPS coordinates
- Socket-based client-server architecture for data transmission
- Support for multiple sensor types (steering wheel angle, vehicle speed, yaw rate, accelerations)

### Display Features

- Real-time console display of all sensor values
- Log file creation with timestamps and system time deltas
- Clean interface showing current simulation time and all sensor readings

## Protocol Design

The simulation uses a simple text-based protocol for communication:

### CAN Frame Format

```
CAN|ID|TIMESTAMP|FRAME_TYPE|VALUES
```

Example:

```
CAN|0018|1760|STEERING|SteeringWheelAngleFrame [ID=0018, Time=1760, Angle=45.5Â°]
```

### GPS Data Format

```
GPS|TIMESTAMP|LATITUDE|LONGITUDE
```

Example:

```
GPS|1000|52.721103|13.223500
```

## Implementation Details

### Timing Mechanism

The simulation maintains accurate timing by:

1. Tracking the real system time since simulation start
2. Calculating the appropriate wait time before sending each message
3. Ensuring sensor values are delivered at exactly the same offsets as in the original recordings

### Multithreading

- The Simulator uses separate threads for each client connection
- The Receiver uses separate threads for socket reception and message processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Socket Connection Refused**:

   - Ensure the Simulator is running before starting the Receiver
   - Check that port 54000 is not blocked by your firewall

2. **Missing or Invalid Data**:
   - Verify that your CAN trace and GPS trace files are correctly formatted
   - Check that file paths are specified correctly when running the Simulator

### as we can see that the when GPStrace.txt file has no data then the startsimulation is printing a error msg

## Future Development

This project will be extended to include GPS data and real-time simulation capabilities.
